                    In the past years, I have been part of multiple startup endeavours in various roles that always had digital solutions laying at their hearts.
                    From creating B2B software solutions as a lead software developer, to implementing user feedback through quantitative and qualitative UX methods,
                    and creating product roadmaps while leading cross-functional teams of product owners, I constantly pursued my passion of building digital products for end-users to enjoy.
                    Optimizing user journeys and business flows is fun to me as I channel my inner laziness and love for automating processes. With the eyes of a designer,
                    the heart of a product manager, and the mindset of a software engineer, I like to see products and teams grow.

                    Also, I'm a 'vegan in denial', a wannabe minimalist, and passionate about training and <a href="https://aruanda.de/aruanda-frankfurt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teaching Capoeira</a> - an afro-brazilian martial art.

                    My hometown is Hamburg where I was born and

                    UIs and a stable architecture in the back, I enjoy building

                    good user experience and keeping the user's needs in mind.
