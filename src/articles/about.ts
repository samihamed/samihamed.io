# Making things useful and engaging.

I'm a software developer and capoeira instructor in Hamburg, the developer of the CapoeiraSongBot and founder of Aruanda Frankfurt. In my studies I became a cultural anthropologist and tree-hugger, traveling Europe to expand my knowledge of Capoeira, and doing little software projects on the side to learn how to build things and make the world a better place. I graduated in social anthropology with a focus on the German startup community [BA] and did research on the evolution of interface design throughout the last few decades (1950 - 2018) and those to come. My hometown is Hamburg where I was born and raised, Frankfurt is where I studied and fell in love with software. In mid-2019 I returned to my hometown Hamburg to work as a full-stack developer. Iâ€™m committed to being a lifelong learner and love to take on challenges as I go.
    
On this website I share my thoughts on the changes in HCI (human-machine interaction), software development, leadership and the afro-brazilian martial art of Capoeira.
    
This page also serves as a showcase platform for projects I'm currently developing and which I have contributed to in the past. From the concept phase towards the technical implementation of beautiful UIs and a stable architecture in the back, I enjoy building useful things while always staying focused on delivering a good user experience and keeping the user's needs in mind.
