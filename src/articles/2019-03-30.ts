## (7 minute read)

This essay goes out to all those who decided to jump on the developer bandwagon a little later than most of their peers. Maybe you’ve just created your first "index.html" file and are interested in what professional software development looks like. Maybe you’ve just landed your first job in web development. Maybe you even have a few years of experience and are now considering moving to a more senior role in your company. Here I humbly share some things I learned while becoming a lead developer in my first year as a self-taught programmer without any formal education in computer science.
Entering the world of professional software development without an education in a relevant field is not exactly easy. I had my first experience with the development of an enterprise web application in my role as a working student in a huge law firm I was working for while studying for my degree in social anthropology. At some point I was asked to supervise the results of a new onboarding-system which the internal ‘IT’ team was developing for new clients. In exchange with a QA manager I tested the new application for months before it would become ready to be released to the public.
Seeing what was possible in the scope of a ‘modern’ web application made me realise how much I would enjoy being able to make things move on the screen on my own. So I started searching for online courses on web development, diving into Javascript tutorials, figuring out how to make buttons move with jQuery and how to create a simple blog with Ruby (on Rails) and my SPA-framework of choice, AngularJs.

I got lucky and had the chance to join a local startup as a working student. The company was just looking to hire new frontend developers for the further development of their web applications. They gave me the chance to prove myself and so I did. Even without much work experience and extensive technical skills I was promptly hired as a full-time frontend developer. Eventually more and more developers and interns joined the team and had to be organised across our three core-products. The CTO, who at this point had become a good friend of mine, asked me if I would feel comfortable to lead the team for one of these products as a disciplinary squad lead and I (sort of) confidently took to the offer.

## (10 minute read)

Conquering the space of numbers - is the first part of a series I’m putting together about the evolution of machine interfaces and their design throughout time. It is based on notes collected during a research I did before starting to work in software development, studying social anthropology at Goethe University in Frankfurt (a. M.), Germany.
In its essence this first part describes early occurrences of machine-user interfaces and how technological innovation has resulted in certain cultural conventions surrounding modern computing tools and our concept and usage of numbers in our everyday life. The rest of the series will describe emerging GUIs (graphical user interfaces) and the future of digital computing devices. In addition things will get spicy once we start talking about a slowly dissolving barrier between the human body, its computational tools and its digital user profile — Cyborgs, in a world held together by binary information.

In this first part, however, I’ll start at “zero” discussing how humanity moved on from early tools to complex machines while developing systems of abstractions and continuously rediscovering the space of numbers on the way.

## 1/5 — Finding numbers
Before numbers started to play a role in society, humans had to learn to externalise meaning and collectively agree on common rulesets surrounding community, values and their immediate environment. Yuval Noah Harari beautifully describes the process on how and why humans started to connect through myths and how they initially started externalising value in currencies and goods in his book Sapiens — a must-read for everyone interested in the development of human society.

## (7 minute read)

When we talk about digital products, we mostly think of video games, mobile apps, and tools which give us access to content — namely Spotify, Youtube, or Medium. We seldom consider that digital products can also serve as a support function for everyday life processes. Working can be digital. Training can be digital. Schooling can be digital. Can even housing become digital?

Since computers took over the workplace, tech companies have made significant progress in digitizing everyday items and services. It takes customers some time to accept these digital products, but the more digital products they use, the more they get used to them.

One of the most impactful cultural shifts around digitization is found in the so-called desktop metaphor. By displaying the top of a user’s desk and designing the product to feel more natural, software companies made their products more accessible. They started a cultural shift that replaced previous working methods with paper and pens… on a desktop.

The concept of work is being supported digitally, and most of you reading this probably appreciate that a lot. How do we find out if the same revolution can occur at home? Here are 3 things I consider when designing digital experiences for our physical products at homefully:

// ## 1 Software development is not all about writing eloquent code

// Since joining the team I had added more than 150.000 lines of code to the products I was asked to develop and maintain. That’s at least what Github told me.
// However, between coding sessions I learned that being a good interface to stakeholders and users was equally as important. Without understanding the need behind a feature I wouldn’t be able to fully explain a development task to my colleagues. Stakeholders aren’t always perfect and it hardly ever happens that they contact you with a fully prepared user-story. So it is important that you as their interface are able to understand whatever they need from your product and translate it to an actionable item on your developers’ todo lists.

// Unless your company employs dedicated designers or product managers, you might have to enable developers to conceptualise features on a non-technical level. In either way you and your developers will have to find a way to define object models and chose the fitting architecture for your system, but unless you can create a functional and approachable interface, your users will not profit from any of it.
// Reading up on UI/UX topics and learning to see your product with the eyes of various user types enables you as a lead to prepare feature requests in a way that will generate business value in the end.

// ## 2 You don’t have to be the best programmer in the team to be a good lead

// When I joined the company I had been building web applications in private for less than a year. I was definitely at a junior level and, in addition, I was the only member of the team who didn’t graduate in computer science. In fact, I had completed a Bachelor’s degree in ‘social anthropology’ a few years earlier and was just going to complete my thesis for my Master’s degree in the same field. Not exactly a technical education in the traditional sense. My team consisted of a full-time intern who was just completing his Master’s degree in computer science and a young professional who had already been developing software as a passion for many years. Appointing me as a squad lead was a risky decision, but it turned out well since I brought some skills to the position which turned out to help us be very productive as a team.

// Being able to put yourself in someone’s shoes is an essential talent if you’re required to translate between stakeholders and developers. This skill combined with some sense of empathy will let you lead a team in a very productive manner. Identifying a colleague’s strengths and understanding their weaknesses allows you to complement them in an efficient way. For example, if you sense that someone feels uncomfortable with the amount of responsibility they were given in a certain project, you can mentor them and let them grow to become more independent. Understanding what excites and motivates your colleagues and users is equally as important as understanding what frustrates them.
// Being a lead doesn’t mean that nobody can teach you anything anymore…

// I remember talking to a newly hired developer who was asking me for some advice on how to solve a problem in the backend. At that point in time I was only working on the frontends of our applications and wasn’t sure how to help out. Still she was convinced that since I was a lead I would certainly know a better way than her to solve the issue. Instead of riding that wave I admitted that I was probably less skilled than her, but that I’d love to help her figure out the issue while explaining to me what exactly she was trying to do. In the end we figured it out together and both learned something on the way.

// ## 3 Startups are an amazing place to grow

// If you’re just starting out with your career in software development, then startups are an amazing place to get started. Depending on the product categories you might join a small team of developers with a very broad skillset, driven from a passion of solving complex problems and creating fantastic products.
// In small interconnected teams, company culture can tend to be equally as important as qualification. If you’re dedicated to grow and join the efforts of growing the company, you will be embraced by the talent surrounding you. You will learn a lot by talking to people from various departments, exchanging ideas for free-time projects and participating in external events with your colleagues. People enjoy sharing their knowledge. It might just be your responsibility to create a space in which they can share it with you. What is important in that context is that you don’t stop to seek challenges. Don’t stop challenging yourself and others.

// While challenging yourself you can set yourself goals like developing small projects in your free-time, using a new framework or that programming language your colleague told you about while having a beer on the terrace.
// While challenging others you can try to do some sparring with your more ‘opinionated’ colleagues and friends. Tell them that only ‘bad programmers comment their code because they forget what it does’. A discussion about ‘tabs vs. spaces’ is also a nice treat for your lunch break.

// ## 4 Humbleness always pays off
// In many career paths people tend to hide behind a mask of ‘fake it till you make it’. This can definitely be useful in a situation in which you are trying to sell an idea, but you need to always be aware of where your limits lie. A good friend of me likes to say: ‘real recognise real’. If you’re exploiting your position to make unqualified decisions, the people with real qualification will soon start to notice. On the other hand, if you stay ‘real’ and approach conflicts with honesty and confidence in the knowledge you have, you will most definitely be rewarded by your skilled peers. Admitting that you do not understand something is a good thing and will most likely lead you towards a solution faster than hiding behind a curtain of technical terms and superficial knowledge.

// If you stay real with yourself and use honesty and transparency as a leadership tool, your peers will respect you for the positive impact you have on your team while allowing you to grow into the position that was given to you.

// This essay was inspired by a conversation I had with a good friend who was at that time considering where to move next in his career as a developer. The beauty about the art of professional software development is that it allows you to go in various directions; from becoming an expert on the underlying technology and excel as a programmer to going into leadership and supervision of the surrounding processes of creating amazing products for the world to profit from.

// The sky is the limit!`
